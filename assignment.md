   4 <= 3
   4 == 4
   4 === 4
   4 != 4
   4 !== 4
   4 != '4'
   4 == '4'
   4 === '4'
6. Figure out the result of the following expressions first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it by using console.log()

   4 > 3 && 10 > 12
   4 > 3 || 10 < 12
   4 > 3 || 10 > 12
   !(4 > 3)
   !(4 < 3)
   !(false)

7. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
   Enter base: 20
   Enter height: 10
   The area of the triangle is 100
8. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)
